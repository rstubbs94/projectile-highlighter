# Projectile Highlighter

A simple accessibility plugin that helps players see projectiles more clearly by adding colored highlights around them.

## Why This Plugin?

Some projectiles in Old School RuneScape can be difficult to see, especially in visually busy environments or for players with visual impairments. This plugin adds a simple colored highlight to make them easier to spot.

**Note:** This plugin does not predict, warn, or provide any information beyond what is already visible on screen. It simply makes existing projectiles a bit easier to see by drawing a colored shape around them.

## What It Does

- Adds a colored circle or tile marker around projectiles you choose to highlight
- Lets you save projectiles into groups so you can turn highlights on/off together
- Shows recently seen projectiles so you can easily add ones you want to track

## How To Use

1. Open the sidebar panel
2. Create a group (e.g. "Zulrah" or "CoX")
3. Add projectile IDs to the group - either manually or from the "Recent Projectiles" list
4. Choose a color that works for you
5. Toggle the group on/off as needed

## Accessibility

This plugin is designed with visibility in mind:
- Choose high-contrast colors that stand out against the game background
- Pick from different highlight styles (outline, filled, or tile-based)
- Adjust the size of highlights to your preference
